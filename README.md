# subdomain-guesser
sub guesser is a tool for guessing subdomain during recon and takes a valid list.txt as input for bruteforcing subdomains
Sub guesser isn't a really good tool as it queries only one ip for a given CNAME... currently working on a recon tool to fix 
this check it out at my HYbrid-Recon repo.

It comes with an extra tool proxy-dns for proxying your dns traffic to specific sites bypassing dns restrictions
